# DFI Data Analyst Task

Please complete the following tasks over a three day period. You will need:
* A Github account
* Either an Amazon Web Services account or a local version of a SQL database manager such as 

## Step 1.
Download the OULA data set from here: https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset

## Step 2.  
Either:  
a) Within AWS, create an instance with a SQL database that you can interface with using SQL code or  
b) On your local machine create a SQL datase that you can interface with using SQL code

## Step 3.
Populate your database with OULA data so that each .csv file is a different table. Take a screenshot of your interface once you have completed this task to show your two tables.

## Step 4.
Review the codebook and database diagram on the OULA webpage. Using SQL join the studentAssessment and studentInfo tables by the id_student variable.

## Step 5. 
Using your new table and SQL create a summary of the mean score, summarized according to region.

## Step 6.
Please implement SQL code to select all students from the studentInfo table who live in a region that has a name where the letter 'c' is the second letter

## Step 7.
Using any varibles from any table look for a pattern that you think is interesting. Please show any code you utilize to investigate the tables. 

## Step 8.
Using whichever visualization software you are most comfortable with, please visualize the pattern you identified in the data and save the image. 

## Step 9.
Write a short explanation of the pattern you found and why you chose to visualize it the way you did.

## Step 10.
Ensure that you have forked and cloned this repository. Upload your screenshot from step 3, your image from step 8, a text file including your explanation and a text file including all your SQL code. Please then pull request your work back to the main branch.

Good luck!
